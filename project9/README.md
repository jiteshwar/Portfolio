A supermarket is self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.
The supermarkets deals with multiple customers and it is very important to understand customers behaviors so that the supermarkets can stock the most sold items or goods prior to its unavailability. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to predict the customerâ€™s behavior. This is a challenge to the supermarket and its partners.
