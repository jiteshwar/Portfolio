Everyone wants to know if they're getting a great deal and what to expect from their investments in the future. If you could know exactly how much your stock investment would be worth in a year, two years, or 10 years, you'd want to know, wouldn't you? 
The stock market or the price of individual stocks is traditionally based on some fundamentals that an investor or investment advisor evaluates to make a judgment as to whether to invest in those stocks. Market behavior is affected by other factors too such as geopolitical events, natural disasters, and the like. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to predict the future expected stock price for a company. This is a challenge to the investors and their consultants.
